              If you’re (1) new to TypeScript, (2) new to{' '}
              <strong>generics</strong>, and (3) <em>struggling</em> to
              understand generics, then you’re exactly like me from 13 years
              ago.
            </P>
            <P>
              Back then, I was studying the Java programming language in
              college. Generics were a relatively new feature for Java at the
              time. I was a beginner programmer then, and{' '}
              <em>generics felt very difficult</em>. So I gave up on actually
              understanding generics and used them without knowing what I was
              doing. I never really understood generics until I had to use them
              a lot for my job.

              Similarly, if you feel that TypeScript generics are too
              difficult—maybe you’ve only done frontend engineering in JS and
              React/Vue, or you’re simply new to programming—this tutorial is
              for you! I’ll try to help you actually understand generics.
            </P>
            <P>
              (If you didn’t find TypeScript generics to be very difficult, this
              tutorial might be too easy for you.)
