              At some point in your coding career, you’ve probably come across a
              piece of spaghetti code that’s not so reader-friendly. It needed
              some <strong>refactoring</strong>.
            </P>
            <EmojiSeparator

            <P>
              Similarly, you’ve probably also come across a coding{' '}
              <strong>tutorial</strong> that’s not so reader-friendly. Maybe you
              wanted to learn a new language, library, or framework, but the
              tutorial you found made you more frustrated than before.
            </P>
            <P>
              But they can be improved. As someone who’s written many coding
              tutorials, I realized that most coding tutorials can be{' '}
              <strong>refactored</strong> to be more reader-friendly—just like
              refactoring code.
            </P>

            <P>
              However, while many programmers have written guidelines on how to
              refactor code, guidelines on how to refactor coding tutorials are
              rare.
            </P>
            <P>
              So, in this article, I’ll share <strong>six</strong> opinionated
              tips on refactoring coding tutorials. I’ve used these techniques
              on my own tutorials to make them more reader-friendly. Here’s the

            <P>
              <strong>Take a look at the code below.</strong> It’s in
              TypeScript, but don’t worry if you don’t know TypeScript. I used
              it for my tutorial called “
              <InternalLink href="/todo">
                <em>{articlesData['todo']['title']}</em>
              </InternalLink>
              ”:
            </P>
            <CodeBlock snippet={snippets.npgx} />
            <P>
              Did you notice that the above code is{' '}
              <em>formatted to fit on a small screen</em>? Because each line
              length is short (max 31 chars), you can read it without
              side-scrolling on most phones.
            </P>
            <P>
              If the above code was formatted in a single line like below
              instead, you’d have to side-scroll or wrap text on a small screen,
              which hurts readability.
            </P>
            <CodeBlock
              snippet={snippets.zgvn}
              caption={
                <>
                  Max line length: <Emoji type="cross" />{' '}
                  <strong>79 characters</strong>
                  <br />
                  <em>Line is too long; must scroll or wrap on a phone</em>
                </>
              }
            />
            <P>
              Here’s another example I used for my tutorial called “
              <InternalLink href="/generics">
                <em>{articlesData['generics']['title']}</em>
              </InternalLink>
              ”. This is <strong>good</strong> formatting (
              <Emoji type="check" /> fits on a small screen):
            </P>
            <CodeBlock
              snippet={snippets.xwbz}
              caption={
                <>
                  Max line length: <Emoji type="check" />{' '}
                  <strong>28 characters</strong>
                </>
              }
            />
            <P>
              And this is the same code in <strong>BAD</strong> formatting (
              <Emoji type="cross" /> doesn’t fit on a small screen):
            </P>
            <CodeBlock
              snippet={snippets.mvsz}
              caption={
                <>
                  Max line length: <Emoji type="cross" />{' '}
                  <strong>72 characters</strong>
                  <br />
                  <em>Line is too long; must scroll or wrap on a phone</em>
                </>
              }
            />
            <P>
              So, here’s my first refactoring tip:{' '}
              <strong>Make code samples in your tutorials mobile-ready.</strong>
            </P>
            <P>
              You can ensure this by <em>keeping line length short.</em> I try
              to keep it under about <em>50 characters</em> (at 14px font size).
              I use <A href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</A> with custom{' '}
              <Code>printWidth</Code> to automate this (my{' '}
              <Code>.prettierrc</Code> is{' '}
              <A href="https://github.com/chibicode/TypeScript-for-Beginner-Programmers/blob/master/.prettierrc">
                here
              </A>
              ).
            </P>
            <EmojiSeparator
              emojis={['prettier']}
              description={<>I use Prettier to keep line length short</>}
            />
            <P>Here are some other techniques:</P>
            <Ul>
              <UlLi>
                Prefer <em>shorter variable names</em> (but don’t sacrifice code
                readability).
              </UlLi>
              <UlLi>
                If you can customize the CSS, <em>use narrow coding fonts</em>.
                I use <A href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</A>
                —it’s slim and looks great. You can also tighten{' '}
                <Code>letter-spacing</Code> to fit more characters.
              </UlLi>
              <UlLi>
                If you want code samples to have longer line length on a larger
                screen, you can use <em>Prettier in the browser</em> to
                dynamically adjust line length based on window width.
              </UlLi>
            </Ul>
            <Hr />
            <P>
              <strong>Why is this necessary?</strong> Because many people{' '}
              <em>actually</em> read coding tutorials on their phones.
            </P>
            <P>
              You might be tempted to assume that your readers will read (and
              follow along) your coding tutorial on a computer.{' '}
              <em>But that’s a bad assumption.</em>
            </P>
            <P>
              In the past, I’ve used Google Analytics to track desktop vs mobile
              usage on my coding tutorials. Even though my tutorials are meant
              to be done on a computer, surprisingly many people accessed them
              from a mobile device.
            </P>
            <P>
              This is because many people <em>discover</em> coding tutorials
              while using a phone to browse Twitter, mailing lists, and online
              forums.
            </P>

            />
            <P>
              That’s why mobile reading experience is important. If you can
              easily read all the code samples on a phone, you might be able to
              finish the tutorial without pulling out your computer. Sometimes
              you need to follow along on your computer to fully understand the
              content, but that’s not always the case.
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>The bottom line:</strong> Assume that people will discover
              your coding tutorial on their phone and try to deliver the best
              possible first impression.

              places where the “<Code>&amp;</Code>” operator can be used, which
              is good, but it could have been done without adding so much noise.
            </P>
            <P>
              If I were to explain how the “<Code>&amp;</Code>” operator works
              in TypeScript, I’d <em>refactor</em> the earlier code as
              follows—it basically does the same thing in a simpler way. You
              don’t need to understand TypeScript to know that this is more
              minimal and focused on explaining how to use the “
              <Code>&amp;</Code>” operator. The amount it takes to understand
              this code is also much shorter.

            <P>
              Take a look below and ask yourself:{' '}
              <em>

              So, here’s my third refactoring tip:{' '}
              <strong>Prefer practical code samples</strong>. Avoid showing code
              no one would write. If you’re trying to teach a new concept (let’s
              call this “<strong>X</strong>”), come up with a <em>practical</em>{' '}
              code sample where <strong>X</strong> is <em>actually</em> useful
              in solving the problem.
            </P>
            <P>
              By showing a practical example, readers will understand why{' '}
              <strong>X</strong> is worth learning. If you show them a useless
              example, they’d think:{' '}
              <em>
                “What’s the point of learning <strong>X</strong>?”
              </em>
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Example:</strong> If I were to explain how to use{' '}
              <Code>number | string</Code> in TypeScript, instead of the earlier{' '}
              <Code>padLeft()</Code> example, I would use the following{' '}
              <Code>
                <strong>paddingLeftCss()</strong>
              </Code>{' '}
              function. The name is similar, but this one is used to generate a
              CSS <Code>padding-left</Code> string:
            </P>
            <CodeBlock
              snippet={snippets.hfdq}
              shouldHighlight={(lineNumber, tokenNumber) =>
                lineNumber === 0 && tokenNumber >= 6 && tokenNumber <= 8
              }
            />
            <P>
              <Code>paddingLeftCss()</Code> can take a <Code>number</Code> or{' '}
              <Code>string</Code>:
            </P>
            <Ul>
              <UlLi>
                If it’s <Code>number</Code>, it returns{' '}
                <Code>padding-left</Code> CSS that’s a multiple of a predefined
                spacing unit. In this case, <Code>1 = 0.25rem</Code>,{' '}
                <Code>2 = 0.5rem</Code>, etc. This would be helpful for visual
                consistency when designing UI.
              </UlLi>
              <UlLi>
                If it’s <Code>string</Code>, it just uses that string as{' '}
                <Code>padding-left</Code>.
              </UlLi>
            </Ul>
            <P>
              This is similar to how UI libraries like{' '}
              <A href="https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system">
                styled-system
              </A>{' '}
              work. In other words, it’s a <strong>practical</strong> example.
              It <em>actually makes sense</em> to have the parameter be either{' '}
              <Code>number</Code> or <Code>string</Code>, unlike the previous
              example.

              In a way, this is similar to{' '}
              <strong>test driven development (TDD)</strong>. In TDD, you write
              a failing test first, and after you watch it fail, you try to make
              it pass. Similarly, in a coding tutorial, it’s more effective if
              you show a failing example first and have the readers watch it
              fail.

              It’s tempting to be lazy and skip writing a failing test in TDD.

              <Emoji type="ghost" /> First, <strong>use themes:</strong>

                theme
              </strong>{' '}
              that ties together your examples, try to add one. Having an
              extremely simple theme is better than having no theme.
            </P>
            <P>
              For example, on{' '}
              <InternalLink href="/todo">one of my tutorials</InternalLink>, I
              teach 8 beginner TypeScript topics{' '}
              <ForegroundHighlight color="gray">
                (types, read-only properties, mapped types, array types, literal
                types, intersection types, union types, and optional properties)
              </ForegroundHighlight>
              . Instead of covering each topic separately, I use a simple theme
              of <strong>building a todo app</strong> to explain all those 8
              topics. The idea is to add features to a todo app one by one using
              TypeScript.
            </P>
            <P>
              First, you implement the “toggle todo” feature of a todo app. This
              lets you check and uncheck the checkboxes—try it below!
            </P>
            <TodoWithData
              promptArrowText={<>↑ Check and uncheck the checkboxes!</>}
              defaultData={[
                { id: 1, text: 'First todo', done: false },
                { id: 2, text: 'Second todo', done: false }
              ]}
            />
            <P>
              To implement this feature, you need to write the{' '}
              <Code>toggleTodo()</Code> function, and in that process, I explain
              <em>TypeScript types, read-only properties, and mapped types</em>.
            </P>
            <P>
              After that, you implement the{' '}
              <strong>“mark all as completed”</strong> feature, which checks all
              the checkboxes at once.
            </P>
            <TodoWithData
              promptArrowText={<>↑ Try pressing “Mark all as completed”</>}
              defaultData={[
                { id: 1, text: 'First todo', done: false },
                { id: 2, text: 'Second todo', done: false }
              ]}
              showMarkAllAsCompleted
            />
            <P>
              To implement this feature, you need to write the{' '}
              <Code>completeAll()</Code> function, and in that process, I
              explain{' '}
              <em>array types, literal types, and intersection types</em> in
              TypeScript.
            </P>
            <P>
              You get the idea. When I want to teach many concepts at once, I
              prefer to use <strong>a specific theme</strong> to explain them
              all—in this case, building a todo app. By doing so, readers won’t
              have to do as much context switching in their head.

              <strong>use analogies</strong> to explain new concepts. Tie a new

            <P>

            <P>
              <strong>Note:</strong> If your analogy isn’t perfect, use it
              anyway but say <em>“it’s not a perfect comparison.”</em> It would
              still help your reader memorize the concept. I did this on my{' '}

                So in a sense, TypeScript’s types act as lightweight unit tests
                that run every time you save (compile) the code. (Of course,
                this analogy is a simplification. You should still write tests

              quote:

                If you’re building tools like me, there’s this fact that we have
                become the new gatekeepers to one of the largest programming
                communities in the world.
              </P>
              <P>
                And this is scary stuff. Because it means that every time our
                tool prints an incomprehensible error message, somebody
                somewhere decides that they’re just not cut out for programming.
                And this is a big responsibility.

                [...] If you’re a maintainer of an open-source project it is
                invaluable to go out there in the field and see what they
                struggle with as they try to use your projects.
              </P>
              <P>
                And if you think improving newcomer experience is polish, it’s
                not polish. If you go out there in the field you will see that
                it makes a real difference in people’s lives, and what they can
                learn, and what they can build with it. So it’s not just polish.
                Take this seriously.

              I think his quote applies not just to coding tools, but also to
              coding tutorials.

              You don’t have to follow all the guidelines I mentioned on this
              page. Sometimes you have to break the rule when refactoring
              code—and the same is true for refactoring tutorials. But do try to
              revise as much as possible. As the saying goes, “Writing is
              rewriting”.
